## Introduction

'Catch Me' is a short web game created with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript - no modules or libraries attached.

In the game, you click a square within a container to increase your score. With each click, however, the square will get smaller and move to a different part of the container. If you run out of time before you click the square, or if you click outside of the square three times, the game will end.

## Game Instructions

### Getting Started

Select a difficulty and click the 'Begin' button to start the game.

- You will notice the square get brighter - this means you can click on it and begin playing.
- If you click outside of the square, you will lose a life - if you run out of lives, the game will end.
- If you run out of time, the game will end.

### Difficulties

## Contributing

If you have ideas for new features, running the game on your local machine is an easy process - fork the repository and open the HTML file in your browser.

- If you're using VSCode, you can install an extension called `live server`. This will make it so that you won't have to reload the page after changing code.
